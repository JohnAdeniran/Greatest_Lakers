            Born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy, Bryant was
            recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the U.S.
            while at Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. The son of former
            NBA player Joe Bryant, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft after
            graduation, and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th
            overall pick; the Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a
            rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan
            favorite by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, and he was named an
            All-Star by his second season. Despite a feud with teammate
            Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA
            championships from 2000 to 2002.
